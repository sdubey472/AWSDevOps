### EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## AWS EKS Deep Dive

### What is AWS EKS?
AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS infrastructure. EKS removes the burden of managing the Kubernetes control plane by handling cluster management tasks such as patching, scaling, and availability.

### Core Concepts

- **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS, highly available, and scalable, running across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Worker Nodes**: EC2 instances or AWS Fargate that run your Kubernetes workloads.
- **Networking**: Integrates with AWS VPC, IAM, and security groups for secure, isolated networking.
- **Add-ons**: AWS supports managed add-ons (CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI, etc.) for easier cluster operations.

### Key Features

- **Security and Compliance**: Integrates with IAM, supports private clusters, and provides encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Scalability**: Clusters can scale to thousands of nodes automatically.
- **High Availability**: Control plane runs across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
- **Integration**: Works with AWS services like ELB, IAM, CloudWatch, ECR, and more.
- **Upgrades and Maintenance**: AWS manages the Kubernetes version and patching.

## Step-by-Step: Creating an Enterprise EKS Cluster using AWS Console

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary permissions (EKS, VPC, IAM, EC2, etc.)
- VPC with at least two subnets in different AZs (for HA)
- IAM role for EKS cluster

### 1. Create or Select a VPC
- Use an existing VPC or create a new one with public/private subnets in at least two AZs.
- Ensure subnets have required tags:  
  - `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name>: shared`
  - `kubernetes.io/role/elb: 1` (public)
  - `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: 1` (private)

### 2. Create an EKS Cluster
1. Go to the **AWS Console** > **EKS** > **Add cluster** > **Create**.
2. Enter a **cluster name**.
3. Choose the **Kubernetes version**.
4. Select the **role** for EKS (must have required permissions: `eks.amazonaws.com`).
5. Select the **VPC** and at least two subnets (preferably private for enterprise workloads).
6. Configure **Cluster endpoint access** (Public, Private, or both).
7. Add optional cluster logging (CloudWatch).
8. Review and click **Create**.

### 3. Configure Node Groups
1. In the cluster page, go to the **Compute** tab > **Add Node Group**.
2. Enter a **name** and select the **node IAM role** (with permissions for EC2, EKS worker nodes).
3. Select **subnets** for the node group (should match with EKS subnets).
4. Choose **instance types** (e.g., m5.large for production).
5. Configure **scaling** settings (min/max/desired nodes).
6. Optionally, enable **remote access** (SSH key).
7. Review and create the node group.

### 4. Configure Networking and Security
- Ensure security groups allow necessary traffic to/from nodes and control plane.
- Use **IAM roles for service accounts** for fine-grained permissions.
- Enable **private endpoint** for enhanced security if required.

### 5. Install and Configure kubectl
- Install `kubectl` and `awscli` locally.
- Update kubeconfig:
  ```bash
  aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>
  ```
- Validate cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

### 6. Deploy Add-ons and Apps
- Use AWS EKS console or CLI to install add-ons like CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI.
- Deploy applications via manifest files or Helm charts.

### 7. Set Up Logging and Monitoring
- Enable CloudWatch logging for cluster/control plane logs.
- Use AWS Container Insights and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

### 8. Implement Security Best Practices
- Enable IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).
- Use Kubernetes RBAC.
- Use network policies.
- Enable encryption for secrets.

## Enterprise Considerations

- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: Always use subnets in at least two AZs for HA.
